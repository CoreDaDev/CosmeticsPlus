# CosmeticsPlus
A cosmetics plugin that is highly incomplete and; unoptimized (as it was roughly coded in a small period of time due to IRL issues), that I got scammed for,

- [ ] Maybe some other things I don't remember off the top of my head.
## IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ
**DO NOT** use this in production, **PLEASE**. If you suffer any consequences such as lag or high memory usasge, don't come to me, I may or may not further maintain this plugin. The plugin is very unoptimized, the source code is very unappealing to look at and I do not recommend using this in production at all. There is no permission system (as the customer requested). This plugin is not even close to being finished, read below for more information on this.
## Why post a 'paid' plugin on GitHub? Isn't that scamming?
Nope. I got scammed. I got paid 10$ beforehand and the original payment was 60$ with a 3 weeks deadline, which you may think, *"Hey, this is more than enough, you're just bad lol..."*, here, let me explain. Due to my mother's gallstone (open) surgery, I had to cut off around 2 weeks, and admittedly I did get a few extra days, I had to wait 5-6 DAYS for payment before they finally informed me they could not pay. *Why could they not pay?* When they originally recruited me, they had 5 requirements, last one being I must get paid through paypal. To this, I simply excused myself and asked if they could buy me giftcards. Now I did not specifically mention buying me items from other shops, but they did buy me something (it was 10$), thus making me think they're okay with that. *Why not just agree with using PayPal?* I live in a country where PayPal is bloked, and I do not own a credit card as I'm under 18. Back to why they could not pay me, apparently they could only use Payoneer to pay me, which they knew I could not use due to lack of some information needed to register a Payoneer account, due to their 'family' reasons. They were going to use PayPal to pay me anyway, why could they not simply buy an item for me or use giftcards? This was very unfortunate for me, I had been waiting the past couple of days for their final response so I paused work.
**I will not leak their name as they were patient when I could not work due to my mother's surgery, which I'm very appreciative of.**
I will provide proof in a screenshots folder. 
The plugin was still incomplete. 
I was being paid 60$ total. *Oh hey, that's a lot for a CosmeticsPlus?!* I had to update an entire virion dependent on an unstable extension and a plugin, add 27 particle shapes (brought it down to around 9 + the already implemented 3 shapes, but I don't know what they meant 'I'm fine giving you another week if you implement all the particles what I want without complaining') and more.
